    <h1>Chromatography Analysis and Design Toolkit</h1>

    The Chromatography Analysis and  Design Toolkit (CADET) is developed at the
    Institute of Bio- and Geosciences 1 (IBG-1) under supervision of Dr. Eric von Lieres.
    The core of the CADET software is a fast and accurate solver for the General Rate Model (GRM)
    of packed bed liquid chromatography, which can be used through this web-interface.
    The CADET solver covers a wide range of GRM variants, combining different transport
    and binding models with state-of-the-art mathematical algorithms and scientific computing techniques.

        <li>
            The governing partial differential algebraic equations (PDAE) are discretized in
            space and time using mass preserving finite volumes (FV) and a backward difference
            formula (BDF).
        </li>
        <li>
            The weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme is applied
            for minimizing numerical dissipation.
        </li>
        <li>Parameter sensitivities are computed using algorithmic differentiation.</li>
        <li>
            The code is parallelized for efficiently utilizing the computational power of modern
            multicore processors.
        </li>
    </ul>
    The CADET framework also comprises a MATLAB interface and standard routines for
    parameter estimation, process optimization and experimental design (not accessible through
    this web-interface). The full version can be downloaded on <a href="https://github.com/modsim/CADET/releases">GitHub</a>.
    CADET is freely distributed as a contribution to the scientific community.
    The CADET simulator is documented using <a href="https://www.cadet-web.de/cadetcs_WSclient/Documentation/">doxygen</a>.
    Additional documentation is provided on the project  <a href="https://github.com/modsim/cadet/wiki">wiki</a>.
    If you find it useful for your own work, we would appreciate
    acknowledgements of the CADET software and citations of our papers.
