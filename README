CADET Web Interface

This is the new web interface project for CADET and designed to be extended by research groups and companies for their own specialized uses.

This interface is part of the CADET (Chromatography Analysis and Design Toolkit) project and is developed at IBG-1: Biotechnology of Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ) under the supervision of Dr. Eric von Lieres. The Chromatography Analysis and  Design Toolkit (CADET) is developed at the
    Institute of Bio- and Geosciences 1 (IBG-1) under supervision of Dr. Eric von Lieres.
    Joel Andersson, Sebastian Schnittert, Andreas Püttmann and Samuel Leweke have made major contributions to the CADET simulator. This web-interface has been created by William Heymann.

## Requirements to use the Website

This website uses a number of more recent html features that are not available in older browsers

For best results use the current version of Chrome or Firefox. Internet Explorer 11 and Edge work with a few speed and graphing limitations. 

# The main CADET website is located at
http://www.cadet-web.de/

This version of the website should replace that one very soon until then this version is running on
